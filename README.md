# Design-and-Implement-a-Parser-for-MiniLang-
This parser is designed to process and interpret the MiniLang programming language. 
MiniLang is a simple yet powerful language that supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, if-else conditions, and print statements.

### Parser Type 
The parser is implemented as a top-down parser.

### Grammar Rules
The parser implements the grammar rules of MiniLang. Each rule corresponds to a specific construct in MiniLang, such as expressions, statements, and programs.

### Syntax Tree
The parser builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the hierarchical structure of the source code. Each node in the tree corresponds to a language construct.
